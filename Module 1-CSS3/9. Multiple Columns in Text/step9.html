    <h2>Community Bulletin</h2>
    <p>This week in Gokuldham Society was nothing short of spectacular! On Monday, Popatlal surprised everyone by announcing his latest matchmaking horoscope reading — spoiler alert: still no good news. Meanwhile, Jethalal’s TV showroom is finally up and running again after that epic power outage. Thanks to Sodhi's jugaad skills, electricity was restored in record time!</p>
    <p>Wednesday’s rainstorm brought an impromptu antakshari night in the clubhouse. From Iyer's unbeatable old classics to Daya Bhabhi’s energetic "garba style" songs, the evening was a melody of madness and memories. Tarak Mehta, as usual, played peacekeeper during the soft clash between Jethalal and Babita Ji about "volume settings".</p>
    <p>Upcoming Events: Don’t miss this Sunday’s *Seva Diwas*, where residents will join hands for a neighborhood clean-up. Later in the evening, there will be a special screening of "Sholay" on the clubhouse projector followed by free soda and samosas courtesy of Abdul!</p>
    <p>In health news, Dr. Haathi recommends everyone to increase their immunity with homemade kadha — recipe available on the society notice board. Tapu Sena, meanwhile, has announced a secret mission to stop Bhide from enforcing early night curfews — more updates soon!</p>
